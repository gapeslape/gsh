gsh
===

A simple bash inspired shell language for learning purposes. Uses flex for lexiographical and bison for grammar parsing.

Supports:

	- piping (cat first | tee second | grep gsh)
	- standard input and output redirects (via < > operators)

It should compile on linux and Mac. To compile use:

```bash
cd gsh
make
```

To run use:
```bash
./gsh
```

Thats about it! Have fun!
